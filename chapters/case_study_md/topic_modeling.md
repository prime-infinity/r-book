## Topic Modeling

Out of the papers returned across the six query types, we identify which ones have full text available in the Semantic Scholar corpus.*

The table below shows how many papers had full body text available. These potentially-relevant papers were used as inputs to the NLP4Dev API, as described in the Methods section.

*In future work, this will be expanded to include a larger corpus including files from multiple open-access corpora.
