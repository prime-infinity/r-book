EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, it is estimated that Lebanon has taken in more than two million Syrian refugees--this into a country with a population of four million Lebanese citizens and 500,000 Palestinian refugees who have lived in the country for decades. Syrian refugees in Lebanon face many challenges, some of the most difficult being: ● In 2015, the Lebanese government stopped allowing the UNHCR to register Syrians entering the country as refugees. Since then, any new arrivals have been consequently unable to access protection or benefits. Given the long and complicated history between the two countries, and the influx of Palestinian refugees who remain in Lebanon decades later, the Lebanese government is making it difficult for Syrians to stay in the country. ● Syrians in Lebanon must obtain residency papers and renew them every six months through an arduous and expensive process. This has resulted in many refugees living, as considered by the The Journal of International Relations, Peace and Development Studies A publication by Arcadia University and the American Graduate School in Paris 101, boulevard Raspail, 75006 Paris – France Tel: +33(0)1 47 20 00 94 – Fax: +33 (0)1 47 20 81 89 Website: www.ags.edu (Please cite this paper as the following: Danielle L.

Page 2 government, illegally in Lebanon which restricts their movements, options, and ability to access employment or education. ● As the Syrian conflict continues, tensions are growing between host communities and refugees. ● The uncertainty around the U.S. travel ban, specifically its impact on the mobility and resettlement of Syrian refugees, drastically diminishes their options and support for a safe and dignified future. Supporting this population in their host countries is more crucial than ever, particularly with scholarships and access to education in many countries presently restricted. This complex emergency has stripped Syrian refugees of access to education and employment. Through our research, we sought to provide recommendations for higher education institutions to develop programs that could lead to economic opportunity for this vulnerable population. With that in mind, the following questions informed our research and recommendations for program design: 1. Where are the intersections of the interests and expectations of Syrian refugees in Lebanon with higher education and employment opportunities? 2. How do individual characteristics such as gender, age, time in exile, and class affect refugees’ perceptions of their higher education needs and ambitions? 3. What are the current barriers refugees face in accessing higher education, and what is the necessary support needed to overcome those barriers? 4. Where are the opportunities for universities, both domestic and international, to fill the gaps in programming or resources? In order to conduct a thorough assessment and answer these research questions, we conducted a systematic literature review and field research. We held interviews with 42 stakeholders, six focus groups with a total of 54 Syrian participants, and deployed a mobile survey taken by 784 Syrian refugees in Lebanon. The information and data collected was disaggregated by gender, age, class, and time in exile, and provided us with insight into the extraordinary circumstances faced by this population. It was apparent that designing a program that addresses their unique needs requires creative thinking, innovative solutions, and adequate support. This report details the conclusions from our research.","[{'authorId': '71465164', 'name': 'Daniel Bernard'}, {'authorId': '2066361000', 'name': 'MaryBeth Bognar'}, {'authorId': '147084177', 'name': 'Jami Hunter'}]",,2018,Journal of International Relations
1,211103442,189,2,MENA PS RESEARCH PROJECT PROTECTION IMPACTS OF CASH-BASED INTERVENTIONS WITH A FOCUS ON CHILD PROTECTION,"UNHCR has been promoting research projects aimed at assessing the contribution of different cash assistance modalities for enhancing child protection outcomes and improving the well-being of refugee children and their households. UNHCR cash assistance programs in the MENA region are some of the largest and most advanced cash programs in the world. UNHCR distributed over US$ 230 million in cash assistance across the region in 2018, reaching some one million individuals. CBI represent an important component of a much broader and integrated network of activities and services provided by UNHCR to provide protection and assistance to the most vulnerable. Existing vulnerability assessment tools such as the Vulnerability Assessment Framework in Jordan (VAF), Vulnerability Assessment for Syrian Refugees in Lebanon (VASyR) and Egypt Vulnerability Assessment of Refugees (EVAR) used for identification of vulnerability focus mainly on socioeconomic factors, with limited weight given to specific protection needs such as child protection or prevention, risk mitigation and response to sexual and gender based violence (SGBV). Separate pathways for CP and SGBV referrals have been developed to address the need to include families provided with child protection case management services among beneficiaries of cash assistance programmes. The region has a critical mass of data that can be analysed to better understand the impact of cash transfers on mitigating protection risks among children.",[],,2020,
2,254071595,189,2,Using Facebook advertising data to describe the socio-economic situation of Syrian refugees in Lebanon,"While the fighting in the Syrian civil war has mostly stopped, an estimated 5.6 million Syrians remain living in neighboring countries1. Of these, an estimated 1.5 million are sheltering in Lebanon. Ongoing efforts by organizations such as UNHCR to support the refugee population are often ineffective in reaching those most in need. According to UNHCR's 2019 Vulnerability Assessment of Syrian Refugees Report (VASyR), only 44% of the Syrian refugee families eligible for multipurpose cash assistance were provided with help, as the others were not captured in the data. In this project, we are investigating the use of non-traditional data, derived from Facebook advertising data, for population level vulnerability assessment. In a nutshell, Facebook provides advertisers with an estimate of how many of its users match certain targeting criteria, e.g., how many Facebook users currently living in Beirut are “living abroad,” aged 18–34, speak Arabic, and primarily use an iOS device. We evaluate the use of such audience estimates to describe the spatial variation in the socioeconomic situation of Syrian refugees across Lebanon. Using data from VASyR as ground truth, we find that iOS device usage explains 90% of the out-of-sample variance in poverty across the Lebanese governorates. However, evaluating predictions at a smaller spatial resolution also indicate limits related to sparsity, as Facebook, for privacy reasons, does not provide audience estimates for fewer than 1,000 users. Furthermore, comparing the population distribution by age and gender of Facebook users with that of the Syrian refugees from VASyR suggests an under-representation of Syrian women on the social media platform. This work adds to growing body of literature demonstrating the value of anonymous and aggregate Facebook advertising data for analysing large-scale humanitarian crises and migration events.","[{'authorId': '72339731', 'name': 'M.

 By focusing on Sudanese refugees and asylum-seekers in Lebanon, who in 2018 constituted 4 per cent of all persons of concern to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in that country, this article explores how the UNHCR protects and assists refugees not encompassed by the mainstream humanitarian response. The article finds that in terms of refugee recognition, resettlement, and overall protection, Sudanese refugees receive differential treatment when compared with the more dominant refugee groups. More precisely, it argues that the humanitarian practices contribute to structural processes of invisibilisation of the particularities of the protection concerns and circumstances of Sudanese refugees. It spotlights how, while racism and racial discrimination remain major protection concerns for the Sudanese community in Lebanon, humanitarian vulnerability assessments are altogether blind to these categories of harm. In examining how Sudanese refugees respond to and resist such processes of invisibilisation, the article also examines two key collective action approaches through which Sudanese refugees seek to access better protection and assistance: the establishment of representative refugee committees, on the one hand, and refugee protest, on the other. It finds that refugee protest was an important means of countering humanitarian processes of invisibilisation.","[{'authorId': '74726527', 'name': 'Maja Janmyr'}]",10.1093/rsq/hdab012,2021,Refugee Survey Quarterly
4,253124810,189,2,Forced Displacement Literature Review,"Between August and October 2017 close to 700,000 ethnic minority Rohingyas fled Myanmar and sought refuge in Bangladesh. The authors use this event as a natural experiment to examine the impact of the influx of Rohingyas on food prices in Ukhia sub-district, the main host region in Bangladesh . 80 percent of the refugees settled in Ukhia sub-district, where the population increased by 300 percent due to the arrival of the refugees. The Rohingya do not have freedom of movement or the formal right to work, although some refugees work informally. The authors analyze 49 food items, looking at their prices 8-12 months before and after the arrival of refugees in the host region, and compare these price movements to those in other similar regions in Bangladesh. The analysis is based on price data collected from sub-district local government offices. The authors conclude that the sudden arrival of large numbers of refugees increased food prices in Ukhia sub-district . Even though food aid mitigated price increases for some food items (low-quality rice and soybeans), there would have been a detrimental impact on the welfare of host communities, at least in the short run. The authors anticipate that decreases in agricultural wages will be reflected in food prices in the long-run. This article examines the effect of inflows of internally displaced persons (IDPs) on food security in host communities in Nigeria. It also examines the differential impacts of displacement due to conflicts, natural disasters and communal clashes on food security in host communities. Food security outcomes are measured using the Food Consumption Score, which is a composite measure of dietary diversity, originally developed by the World Food Program. The analysis is based on the food consumption module of the General Household Survey (GHS) from the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics, together with survey data on IDPs from IOM. to respond to insurgency-driven displacement, compared to other types of forced displacement crises. In particular, security challenges create additional impediments to accessing communities. The authors advocate for greater preparedness for insurgency-based displacement, including through anticipatory early warning systems, more rapid needs assessment, budgetary provisions for response agencies ahead of the displacements, and more understanding of the demographics of displaced populations. This paper examines the different determinants of internal and external displacement . The author argues that people flee their homes when the expected utility of leaving exceeds the expected utility of staying, and that in general external displacement is costlier than internal displacement, due to additional risks to personal safety and increased financial hardships associated with crossing a border and adapting to life in a new country. However, when violence is perpetrated by government or there is widespread insurgent violence across the country, the risks of staying and the benefits of fleeing the country are high, and people are more likely to flee across borders. The analysis is based on refugee and IDPs flows between 1989 and 2017 from UNHCR and data on conflict from the Armed Conflict Dataset from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program/Peace Research Institute in Oslo (UCDP/PRIO). The author also controls for political, economic and geographic factors, drawing on data from the World Bank (level of economic development), Polity IV dataset (regime type) and Transborder Ethnic Kin Dataset (ethnic relations between origin and destination country). The author finds that the pattern of displacement depends on: (1) the perpetrator; and (2) the geographical spread of the violence. Specific findings are as follows: different abroad , differentiating between: (a) indirect violence (such as shelling or shooting), which is less likely to target specific individuals but occurs due to proximity to a battlefield; and (b) direct violence (including physical assaults, torture, sexual violence, abductions, forced labor, and wage theft), which specifically targets individuals. Following Schewel (2019), the frame the analysis in terms of an individual’s motivation to migrate (aspiration) that may be impeded by their capacity to migrate (capability). The analysis is based on a novel dataset that includes: (a) demographic data, arrival and return dates (if applicable) for two million Syrian refugees from UNHCR’s Profile Global Registration System (ProGres) database; (b) data on living conditions in Jordan and Lebanon from vulnerability surveys conducted by UN agencies; and (c) conditions in Syria from a conflict-events database and nightlights data for Syria This paper estimates the causal effect of inflow Syrian refugees on crime rates in Turkey . By the end of 2020, the number of Syrian refugees in Turkey had reached 3.6 million, almost all of whom live outside of refugee camps in host communities. The authors examine variations in refugee numbers and crime rates per 100,000 inhabitants (including natives and refugees) across Turkish provinces and over time for the period 2008-2019. The analysis is disaggregated by category of crime, including: assault, crimes involving firearms and knives, homicide, robbery, smuggling, theft, sexual crimes, kidnapping, defamation, use and purchase of drugs, and production and commerce of drugs. The analysis is based on provincial crime data from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TURKSTAT) together with several additional province-level datasets. informal sector, displacing low-skilled Turkish workers who may consequently resort to illegal activities. The authors offer several possible explanations for this counter-intuitive result: (i) the threat of detention or refoulement may deter refugees from crime; (ii) employment of refugees in the informal sector and cash assistance programs may provide adequate income, eliminating the necessity to resort to illegal activities; and (iii) many Turkish natives displaced from the formal labor market found employment and increased wages in the expanding formal labor market. This article examines the impact of including refugee children in government schools on learning achievement of both refugee and native pupils in the West Nile region of Uganda . Between June 2016 and December 2017, the refugee population in Uganda increased from 0.2 million to 1.4 million, largely due to the arrival of large numbers of refugees from South Sudan. As of October 2017, when data for this study was collected, there were more than 1 million South Sudanese refugees in Uganda, the majority hosted in the West Nile region. Humanitarian agencies and non-governmental organizations established donor-funded schools in the refugee settlements when there weren’t any nearby government schools. Government schools also donor assistance proportionate to the number of refugees they enrolled. The analysis draws on household survey data collected from South Sudanese refugees and host communities, including learning assessments. During the survey, a questionnaire was administered to household heads (or their representatives) to collect information on the households and children aged 16 and younger. English and mathematics tests were administered to all children aged 6 to 16, regardless of their school attendance. This article examines the causal effect of refugees resettled in the United State (US) on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows from the US to refugees’ countries of origin, and studies the case of Vietnamese ‘boat people’ who arrived in the US in 1975. Specifically, the authors examine the effect of refugees who entered the US between 1990 and 2000 on FDI to their countries of origin between 2005 and 2015. For the case of Vietnamese boat people, the authors examine the effect of country policies and refugees’ human capital in influencing FDI from the US to Vietnam. The analysis is based on confidential data on the universe of refugees resettled in the US between 1990 and 2015 from the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM) of the US Department of State, together with project-level FDI data from fDiMarkets, a research arm of the Financial Times Group (FT). The authors conclude that refugees foster FDI to their origin countries approximately a generation after they were first resettled, and this effect is larger when peace and political stability prevail in origin countries . These findings demonstrate the strong ties that refugees maintain with their origin countries years or even decades after their displacement. This article provides a systematic review of 12 studies published between 2008 and 2018 on self-harming behavior among refugees and asylum-seekers in Europe . Self-harming behavior is defined as the deliberate and self-inflicted damage of body tissue (such as cutting, burning, scratching the skin or hitting) without suicidal intent and for purposes not socially or culturally sanctioned. Most of the articles included in the review investigated refugees’ mental health broadly, including some self-harm episodes. The lack of specific research on self-harming behavior among refugees and asylum-seekers might be due to difficulties accessing this population, or because the scientific community is reluctant to recognize self-harm as an independent clinical condition, and tend to associate it with other syndromes.","[{'authorId': '2140164897', 'name': 'A.
