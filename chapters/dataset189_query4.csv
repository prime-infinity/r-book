0,233941517,189,4,A Multidimensional Approach to Measuring Vulnerability to Poverty of Syrian Refugees in Lebanon,"The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that about 80 million persons have been forcibly displaced within or outside of their country’s borders. As humanitarian organizations and host communities operate under increasing constraints, there is a growing need to identify targeting mechanisms that support a more coordinated humanitarian-development approach to the mobilization and distribution of resources. This study uses vulnerability assessment data collected by the UNHCR, WFP, and UNICEF from Syrian refugees in Lebanon, a country that hosts an estimated 1.5 million refugees from neighboring Syria and the highest per capita proportion of refugees in the world. The data are used to construct a multidimensional livelihood index (MLI) to identify refugee households who are currently poor. The MLI is then used to assess households’ vulnerability to future poverty using a standard approach for cross-sectional data. Specifically, a 3-stage Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS) model is estimated to predict which households are expected to “fall into” or “out of” multidimensional poverty in the future. Our findings support the view that poverty is a dynamic phenomenon and not a static condition. The analysis allows us to identify more clearly which households and geographical locations are more vulnerable to experiencing prolonged poverty. This study is among the first to adapt the multidimensional poverty framework to the context of protracted forced displacement. It does this using a forward-looking approach to identify who, where, and how to target humanitarian assistance and development interventions more optimally, to prevent rather than simply alleviate immediate poverty.","[{'authorId': '50582247', 'name': 'Angela C.

1,3713394,189,4,"Nutritional Status of Women and Child Refugees from Syria — Jordan, April–May 2014","As a result of civil war, an estimated 2.8 million refugees have fled Syria and reside in neighboring countries, mainly Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan, and Iraq. The largest Syrian refugee camp in the region is Zaatari camp in Jordan, with approximately 79,000 refugees; another estimated 500,000 Syrian refugees live in Jordanian cities, towns, and villages, mostly in the capital (Amman) and in four northern governorates (Irbid, Mafraq, Jarash, and Zarqa). Although all registered refugees in Jordan receive food vouchers from the World Food Programme (WFP) and vulnerable refugees receive cash assistance from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and nongovernmental organizations, the nutritional status of some refugees might be compromised because of dislocation, lack of income, and limited access to nutritious foods. To assess the nutritional status of Syrian refugees, UNHCR, WFP, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Medair International (a nongovernmental organization), and CDC, in collaboration with the United Nations Population Fund and the World Health Organization (WHO), conducted cross-sectional, population-representative cluster surveys in Zaatari camp and among refugees residing in the host community. The surveys were conducted during April-May 2014 with the principal objective of assessing nutritional status of refugee children aged 6-59 months and nonpregnant women of reproductive age (15-49 years). Preliminary findings indicated a high prevalence of anemia in Zaatari camp among both children and women (48.4% and 44.8%, respectively). Nutrition policies aimed at ensuring optimal child and maternal micronutrient status and addressing the underlying risk factors for anemia are likely to result in improved health outcomes and a reduction in anemia.","[{'authorId': '4959427', 'name': 'O.

2,213910172,189,4,Germany’s Financial Contributions to the UN System from 2008 to 2018,"From 2008 to 2018, Germany became one of the largest contributors to the United Nations system. Since 2015, its voluntary contributions have increased significantly, but additional funds are directed almost exclusively to humanitarian agencies (e.g. WFP, UNHCR, UNICEF and UNRWA) and UNDP. Germany’s increasing engagement is mainly a response to the refugee and migration policy in recent years, and is thus politically fragile. A large share of German contributions is also tightly earmarked, undermining multilateral decision-making. It will depend on political will whether Germany can evolve from being not only a large donor, but also one that supports increased core funding to the UN system.","[{'authorId': '66500738', 'name': 'K.

3,211103442,189,4,MENA PS RESEARCH PROJECT PROTECTION IMPACTS OF CASH-BASED INTERVENTIONS WITH A FOCUS ON CHILD PROTECTION,"UNHCR has been promoting research projects aimed at assessing the contribution of different cash assistance modalities for enhancing child protection outcomes and improving the well-being of refugee children and their households. UNHCR cash assistance programs in the MENA region are some of the largest and most advanced cash programs in the world. UNHCR distributed over US$ 230 million in cash assistance across the region in 2018, reaching some one million individuals. CBI represent an important component of a much broader and integrated network of activities and services provided by UNHCR to provide protection and assistance to the most vulnerable. Existing vulnerability assessment tools such as the Vulnerability Assessment Framework in Jordan (VAF), Vulnerability Assessment for Syrian Refugees in Lebanon (VASyR) and Egypt Vulnerability Assessment of Refugees (EVAR) used for identification of vulnerability focus mainly on socioeconomic factors, with limited weight given to specific protection needs such as child protection or prevention, risk mitigation and response to sexual and gender based violence (SGBV). Separate pathways for CP and SGBV referrals have been developed to address the need to include families provided with child protection case management services among beneficiaries of cash assistance programmes. The region has a critical mass of data that can be analysed to better understand the impact of cash transfers on mitigating protection risks among children.",[],,2020,
4,28302919,189,4,Under- and overnutrition: a global perspective.,"The world is now confronted with a set of medical problems of nutritional origin with which it has never previously had to contend, i.e. both undernutrition of various types and a huge and rapidly escalating burden of diseases crudely classified as relating to overnutrition. The problems of malnutrition, particularly affecting young children, were highlighted in the developing world in the 1950s by a remarkable series of studies emanating from first-class nutrition research centers in Africa, Asia and Latin America, e.g. in Chile, India, Jamaica, the Lebanon, Mexico, Peru, Thailand and Uganda. In nutritional circles, for example, malnutrition was often considered to be a practical problem of improving children’s nutrition with multifaceted approaches to improve the maternal and nutritional care of the young child. The promotion of breast-feeding followed by appropriate weaning was vital, together with a recognition of the fundamental human right of poor families to have adequate support. The World Health Organization (WHO) continued to encourage the monitoring of individual children’s growth by means of national statistics while other UN agencies such as UNHCR and WFP, as well as non-governmental organizations, coped with the mounting crises of refugees and displaced persons fleeing from a multitude of wars, or attempting to survive the effects of droughts, floods and consequent crop failures. Support for the steady improvement in agricultural production, on which the escalating numbers of the world’s poor depend, was universally accepted and was the responsibility of FAO and the CGIARs, funded by Western governments, the World Bank and the IMF. More recently, in response to the drive by Grant, the former Director General of UNICEF, the world’s Presidents and Prime Ministers expressed their commitment to tackling the continuing burden of childhood malnutrition at a Children’s Summit [1].

5,245652815,189,4,Editorial: Food Security and Food Safety Challenges in Venezuela,"Venezuela has suffered a massive shift in status. Once considered an affluent nation with the largest proven fossil-fuel reserves in the world, and classified as an upper-middle income country, declines in oil production, fuel availability and flawed macroeconomic decisions, disrupted all sectors of the economy. A large proportion of the population had ready access to food, health services, clean drinking water, sanitation, domestic gas, electricity, fuel, and transport, but declines in food production, real income, and living conditions have generated malnutrition and food insecurity, forcing complex survival strategies. All this gave rise to a humanitarian space. In 2019, this space was expanded through the installation of the international humanitarian coordination architecture of the UN. Under the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), a country team and eight clusters were established: food security/livelihoods; water/sanitation/hygiene; education; nutrition; health; protection; shelter/energy/non-food items and logistics. OCHA indicates the humanitarian situation has not abated following six consecutive years of economic contraction, inflation/hyperinflation, political/social/institutional tensions, the COVID-19 pandemic and international sanctions1. According to The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) people continue to leave the country to escape violence, insecurity, and threats as well as a lack of food, medicine, and essential services, becoming one of the largest displacement crises in the world, with 5.9 million seeking better conditions elsewhere2. The prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) has increased almost 4-fold: from 6.4% in 2012– 2014 to 21.2% in 2016–2018 (Figure 1). During the same recession period, reported inflation reached circa 10 million percent and growth in the real GDP worsened, going from negative 3.9 percent in 2014 to an estimated negative 25 percent in 2018 (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO, 2019). Figure 1 shows a sustained increase in PoU since 2009. This would appear to repudiate, or at least not corroborate official claims attributing PoU to sanctions in place since 2017.","[{'authorId': '8121696', 'name': 'M.
