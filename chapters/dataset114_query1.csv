0,134273560,114,1,"Event review: 3rd International Conference on Best Practices in World Heritage: Integral Actions. Mahon (Menorca, Balearic Islands, Spain) 2nd to 5th of May 2018","The 3rd International Conference on Best Practices in World Heritage was held in Mahon from the 2nd to 5th of May. Alicia Castillo and Ángeles Querol (Complutense University of Madrid, Spain – UCM), with their team of diligent students successfully organized the third in the series of conferences supported by the Island Council of Menorca. This year’s was Integral Actions, aptly reflecting the interdisciplinary and dynamic nature of managing cultural landscapes. As more sites are inscribed to the World Heritage List, the boundaries of cultural landscapes become increasingly permeable, demanding integrated management approaches that respect the diversity of these landscapes and their local communities, while encouraging greater cooperation between a broader range of actors. Stephan Döempke (World Heritage Watch, Germany) opened the conference with a keynote lecture on sustainable protection and sustainable development. Painting a sobering picture of the complexity of managing World Heritage sites (WHS) in Tajikistan, Ethiopia, China and Georgia, he described the lack of local infrastructure, resources, support and effective coordination between various local and international actors as challenges that impact the protection and management of sites, but notably impact the lives of resident communities. The need to engage local civic societies as well as volunteers, practitioners, and academics in designing and implementing management strategies that support sustainable development, while protecting WHS, was a message that underlined the sessions which followed. Presentations on Florence, Edinburgh, Bali, Moche Valley and Qhapaq Ñan, described the complex and often challenging interactions between government entities, civic societies and community members, and the role that NGOs play in addressing some of these challenges. With Renée Siván (Chief Curator, Tower of David Museum, Jerusalem) as moderator, the presentations were linked by Professor Nobuko Inaba’s (Tsukuba University, Japan) lecture, describing the interplay of nature and culture in Japanese cultural sites, and the role of local government and communities in the sustainable management of these sites. Professor Juan Luis Arsuaga (UCM) began the second day with a scientific look at the earliest examples of cultural heritage, inaugurating the scientific theme of the day. Moderated by Dr. Charles Musiba (University of Colorado, USA), the subsequent presentations revealed inextricable links between science, heritage conservation, public health and well-being. More than one presentation gave examples of recruiting citizen scientists as an effective strategy in fostering stronger civic engagement in protecting WHS. Perhaps the most significant lesson was reciprocal knowledge exchange between heritage scientists and local residents, whereby each fulfilled a complementary role in the holistic management and protection of sites. The two next sessions primarily focused on integrating cultural heritage management with sustainable development. The presentations addressed the mutable nature of heritage values, challenges of balancing competing values, protection of intangible heritage as well as devising strategies that protected Outstanding Universal Values in the face of increasing economic pressures and ambitious political agendas.

Tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)iron (Feq3), a novel compound, was synthesized. Feq3 induced the death of HNSCC cells and caused them to exhibit the morphological features of apoptosis. Feq3 also induced apoptosis of SCC9 cells by cell cycle arrest during the G2/M phase and the induced arrest of SCC25 cells in the G0/G1 and G2/M phases, which was associated with decreased cyclin B1/cdc2 and cyclin D/cdk4 expressions. Feq3 increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduces glutathione (GSH) levels, and responds to increased p53 and p21 expressions. Feq3 induced apoptosis by mitochondria-mediated Bax and cytochrome c up-expression and down-expression Bcl-2. Feq3 also up-regulated tBid, which interacts with the mitochondrial pathway and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)/TNF-Rs, FasL/Fas, and TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand receptors (TRAIL-Rs)/TRAIL-dependent caspases apoptotic signaling pathway in HNSCC cells. However, Feq3 activates Fas but not FasL in SCC25 cells. Feq3 arrests the growth of HNSCC cells and is involved in the mitochondria- and death receptor (DR)-mediated caspases apoptotic pathway. This study is the first to suggest that apoptosis mediates the anti-HNSCC of Feq3. Feq3 has potential as a cancer therapeutic agent against HNSCC.","[{'authorId': '88763211', 'name': 'Leong‐Perng Chan'}, {'authorId': '5701682', 'name': 'Ya-Ping Tseng'}, {'authorId': '50557030', 'name': 'Cheng Liu'}, {'authorId': '5843243', 'name': 'H.

9,251263973,114,1,Rainfall variability and trends in the Borana zone of southern Ethiopia,"
 This paper has examined the variability and trends of rainfall in the Borana zone, southern Ethiopia. Monthly rainfall data from 1981 to 2018 were obtained from the National Meteorological Agency (NMA) of Ethiopia. Mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation were employed to analyze temporal variability. Mann–Kendall (MK) test and Sen's slope estimator (SEE) were used to determine trend and its magnitude, respectively. The inverse weighting distance (IDW) interpolation technique was employed to generate surface data and produce spatial rainfall maps. April and Belg were the wettest month and season, respectively. On an annual basis, Arero (741 mm) followed by Teltele (629 mm) were the wettest stations, whereas the Dillo station (285 mm) was the driest. Rainfall is highly variable on a monthly and seasonal basis than annual timescale. Meher rainfall has shown a significant rainfall increase (P-value <0.05) at most stations. A significant increase in annual rainfall was observed at Arero, Dehas, Dillo and Miyo. Spatially, rainfall decreases from the northeast and northwest parts of the Borana towards the southwest. The findings of this study can serve as a reference basis and provides useful information for policymakers to devise and implement better water management strategies in this water-scarce region.","[{'authorId': '2037338666', 'name': 'Mitiku Adisu Worku'}, {'authorId': '12065237', 'name': 'G.

Assessing the level of livelihood vulnerability of pastoralists is essential to identify better adaptation strategies to climate change. Thus, this study assessed vulnerability of pastoralists’ livelihood to climate change and adaptation options at Dillo District of Borena zone, Oromia Region, Ethiopia. Accordingly, historical climate data (1989-2018) was collected from National Meteorological Agency (NMA) of Ethiopia. In addition, data of livelihood vulnerability and adaptation options were collected from a total of 145 households that were randomly selected. The Mann-Kendall test and Sen’s slope estimator were employed to assess trends of rainfall and temperature. Climate data and vulnerability of pastoralists’ livelihood were analyzed by INSTAT+v.3.36 and XL-2010 whereas adaptation options used by the pastoralists were analyzed using Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences (SPSS) (version 20). The results revealed a decreasing trend for both annual (8.226 mm/year) and seasonal (-5.53 mm/year for belg and -0.956 mm/year for bega) rainfall during the study period. In contrast, the annual minimum and maximum temperature showed an increasing trend with a magnitude of 0.071 and 0.006 C per year respectively. Overall, Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) for Golbo and Malbe were 0.41 and 0.32 respectively, indicating Golbo was more vulnerable to climate change as compared with Malbe. Similarly, the LVI of Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change analysis result showed that Golbo (0.275) was more vulnerable than Malbe (0.238). Increasing livestock mobility and casual labor as a source of income were mostly used adaptation options in the study area. More emphasis should be given to pastoralists of the study area especially to Golbo zone by concerned bodies in order to improve their resilience to changes in climate variables. Further research is needed to adopt model in the future to identify more suitable adaptation options in the area.","[{'authorId': '117154766', 'name': 'Mengistu Mengesha'}]",,2021,

On the other hand, future climate changes (2018–2050) were analyzed based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 5 (CMIP5) model outputs under under two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios, RCP 4.5 and 8.5. The results showed high inter-seasonal and inter-annual variability of rainfall and temperature in the studied watershed over the last four decades. The annual and Kiremt (June–September) rainfall showed a generally increasing trend, while the Belg (March–May) rainfall exhibited a decreasing trend between 1986 and 2017. Conversely, the minimum, maximum and mean temperature demonstrated increasing trends over the study period although most of the detected trends were statistically insignificant at 5 and 10% level of significance.

15,234392684,114,1,"Assessing the Impact of Rainfall Variability on Teff Production and Farmers Perception at Gubalafto District, North Eastern, Ethiopia","Rainfall variability adversely impacts crop production and imposes a major constraint on farming planning, mostly under rain fed conditions across developing countries. Rainfall variability from season to season greatly affects soil water availability to crops, and thus poses crop production risks to agriculture which is a major economic activity in Gubalafto District, Ethiopia. It was observed that farmers tend to rely on their accumulated experience about weather conditions in the schedule of their farm operations. Therefore, this study was designed to examine the impact of rainfall variability on teff production and farmers perception in Gubalafto district, Ethiopia. The Primary data were obtained through questionnaire administration and field observations among the farmers in Gubalafto district. Stratified random sampling technique was employed in the selection of sample size and a total of 203 farmers were randomly selected for the study. The secondary data was obtained from National Meteorological Agency of Ethiopia (daily rainfall between 1984 and 2018) and Teff yield was collected from North Wollo Agricultural Office (2010-2018). Coefficient of variation, standardized anomaly index (SAI), precipitation concentration index (PCI) were used to evaluate rainfall and Teff yield variability. Sen’s slope estimator and Mann-Kendall’s test were used to determine the magnitude and trends of changes, respectively. The analysis revealed that rainfall in the district is highly variable both in space and time for the last years. The coefficient of variation showed that seasonal rainfall distribution is highly variable than annual time scale. The rainfall trends showed decreasing non-significantly in both belg and bega season while increasing non significantly in both annual and kiremt time scale over the study area. Significant correlations exist between amount of rainfall and Teff production. Hence small changes in amount and distribution of seasonal rainfall causes significant negative impacts on Teff production that varies from reduced yield to the total loss of the crop. The result of the regression analysis shows rainfall characteristics contributed 86% in explaining the variations in the yield of Teff per hectare in the study area. Both farmers’ perceptions and meteorological data show that rainfall is much more unreliable in the study area. Most farmers reported that Teff yield is a decreasing pattern over time due to shortage of rainfall, frequent irregularity of rainfall and other factors. Therefore, specific adaptation strategies are needed for the study area to cope with the risks, sustain farming and improve food security.","[{'authorId': '2091622537', 'name': 'Bahiru Wagaye'}, {'authorId': '2091235797', 'name': 'Wende Endalamaw'}, {'authorId': '2091234897', 'name': 'Mohammed Lubaba'}, {'authorId': '90380428', 'name': 'M.

16,233329843,114,1,Earth Observation-Based Detectability of the Effects of Land Management Programmes to Counter Land Degradation: A Case Study from the Highlands of the Ethiopian Plateau,"In Ethiopia land degradation through soil erosion is of major concern. Land degradation mainly results from heavy rainfall events and droughts and is associated with a loss of vegetation and a reduction in soil fertility. To counteract land degradation in Ethiopia, initiatives such as the Sustainable Land Management Programme (SLMP) have been implemented. As vegetation condition is a key indicator of land degradation, this study used satellite remote sensing spatiotemporal trend analysis to examine patterns of vegetation between 2002 and 2018 in degraded land areas and studied the associated climate-related and human-induced factors, potentially through interventions of the SLMP. Due to the heterogeneity of the landscapes of the highlands of the Ethiopian Plateau and the small spatial scale at which human-induced changes take place, this study explored the value of using 30 m resolution Landsat data as the basis for time series analysis. The analysis combined Landsat derived Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data with Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) derived rainfall estimates and used Theil-Sen regression, Mann-Kendall trend test and LandTrendr to detect changes in NDVI, rainfall and rain-use efficiency. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis was used to relate changes in vegetation directly to SLMP infrastructure. The key findings of the study are a general trend shift from browning between 2002 and 2010 to greening between 2011 and 2018 along with an overall greening trend between 2002 and 2018. Significant improvements in vegetation condition due to human interventions were found only at a small scale, mainly on degraded hillside locations, along streams or in areas affected by gully erosion. Visual inspections (based on Google Earth) and OLS regression results provide evidence that these can partly be attributed to SLMP interventions. Even from the use of detailed Landsat time series analysis, this study underlines the challenge and limitations to remotely sensed detection of changes in vegetation condition caused by land management interventions aiming at countering land degradation.","[{'authorId': '2080047642', 'name': 'Esther Barvels'}, {'authorId': '3012171', 'name': 'R.

Human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hUC-MSCs) have been reported to have multipotent differentiation ability. However, the therapeutic impact and mechanisms of dopamine neuronal differentiation from hUC-MSCs in PD are not determined. Here we developed a new protocol to induce dopamine neuron conversion from hUC-MSCs by addition of the growth cocktail containing noggin, CHIR99021, SHH, FGF8, TGFβ, GDNF, and BDNF. Then we transplanted the hUC-MSCs and the growth factor cocktail into the lesion side of the midbrain of 6-OHDA lesioned rat model of PD. The effects of hUC-MSC transplantation on the dopaminergic neuronal differentiation and motor behaviors of the rats were investigated. We found that in the presence of these molecules, the cultured hUC-MSCs showed a high efficient DA neuronal conversion in vitro . In combination with the growth cocktail, grafted hUC-MSCs also showed a highly efficient DA neuronal conversion in the midbrain of 6-OHDA lesioned rats. Both the grafted hUC-MSCs and the differentiated TH-positive neurons survived in 6-OHDA lesioned rats during the post-grafting period of 16 weeks. The hUC-MSCs-derived TH-positive neurons displayed the same electrophysiological profile as DA neurons in vivo . More importantly, rats with transplanted hUC-MSCs showed progressive improvements in motor behaviors compared to controls from weeks 4 to 16 post-grafting. These results demonstrated the efficacy and usefulness of the growth cocktail in combination with hUC-MSC transplantation in 6-OHDA lesioned rats and provided a promising cell-based treatment strategy for the PD patients.","[{'authorId': '40330709', 'name': 'F.

19,253124847,114,1,"C-1-1 Mapping Urban Areas Using the Landsat-8 Image Acquired in Daegu, South Korea by Using Machine Learning and Aerial Imagery-based Estimation of Marine Farming Facilities Capacity in Wando-gun, South Human","Mapping urban areas is important for monitoring urban development and preventing urban disasters. In this research, the two algorithms such as machine learning and urban index were employed for mapping the urban areas using the Landsat-8 image acquired in Daegu, South Korea through the following steps. First, the machine learning technique was employed for detecting the urban areas from the given Landsat-8 image. Next, the urban areas were also detected from the urban index image generated using the multispectral bands of the Landsat-8 satellite image. Finally, the accuracy of these detected urban areas was separately assessed. The marine farming business is conducted in seas, making it difficult to identify the state of marine farms, and the illegal marine farming facilities worsen the fishing environment, and lead to the production and distribution of low-quality farmed marine products thus harming the appropriate supply of marine products and stabilization of prices. Therefore, this study used high-resolution aerial images of Wando-gun, South Jeolla Province, Korea in estimating the facility capacity for laver, sea mustard, abalone, fish and oysters so the marine farms state was identified along with the identification of illegal marine farming. To that end, the marine farming approval book was arranged according to the standardized table so as to build property DB. The location and area map of the water surface was digitized based on the GPS coordinates, and thus a spatial DB was constructed. The DB then was integrated into a single GIS database and superimposed on the aerial imagery. Further, to verify the accuracy of this study, the administrative data of the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries and Wando- gun was compared. This study enables the estimation of the itemized facility capacity, making it possible to ensure a systematic management of marine farms, and to serve as the basic research data and estimate the output for production statistics agencies. For the human-centric society and improving individual Quality of Life (QOL), extracting and analyzing key QOL indicators are crucial. In this paper, we aim to develop a model to extract key QOL mobility indicators from a city-scale low-sampling rate mobile phone GPS data. The model estimates stochastic individual activity from mobility pattern and we evaluate the result based on census and other related panel survey data. The individual key indicators can be used for spatiotemporal analysis and also useful for aggregated analysis in the different spatiotemporal units. We showcase the advantage of our model using a web- based analytic dashboard. The population of Nanto city is declining year by year due to the sub-replacement fertility and the aging of the population and the migration from small and medium-sized cities to metropolitan areas. Population decline has had a major impact on the social structure and economic development of the city of Nanto. The reduction of residents in Nanto leads to the idling of many communal facilities, as well as the reduction of local tax revenue and the increase of the operation and maintenance cost of public facilities. The decrease in the population has imposed a serious financial burden on the local government. To address the problem, the government of Nanto has proposed a plan to restructure public facilities in which officials prepared to sell underutilized facilities to the private sector for reducing public facilities. In order to effectively distinguish public facilities with different utilization rates and predict the number of visitors. This paper will use mobile phone data and relevant models to statistically analyze and predict the frequency and number of visitors to public facilities by local residents, so as to help the government formulate a public facility restructuring plan. and environmental background for designing suitable policy measures to improve and restore the environment. Africa is the continent facing many challenges and suffers from various drastic environmental problems, including drought, deforestation, water pollution, Argo- industrial agriculture, overfishing and overgrazing, etc. Here we quantify the status of eco-environmental vulnerability in African Countries (57 countries), employing 16 indicators across six domains, including hydrometeorology, natural hazards, socioeconomics, land resources, topography, and climate change. The eco-environmental vulnerability is scaled into six levels consisting of potential, light, slight, medium, heavy, and very heavy. Results show that different African Countries have widely varying patterns of eco-environment vulnerability requiring different unique performances for environmental improvement. Among African Countries, a largest fraction of very heavy vulnerability level is attributed to Ethiopia (27.96%), followed by Madagascar, Kenya, Nigeria, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Congo (16.61%, 7.09%, 5.67%, 5.30%, 5.04%, 2.48% respectively). In general, high vulnerability levels are concentrated in Southeast Africa where are of low-income nations with high population and growing rate, and suffer from high frequencies of natural hazards. These findings help us understand the key ecological and environmental characteristics of African Continent to assist policy-makers to set improvement targets on specific areas and adopt effective practices, while keeping track of other aspects of eco-environment. different time scales indicate the different forms of drought. The monthly gridded data of Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations precipitation, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroscopy Terra NDVI products were used to assess the spatial and temporal meteorological drought. Furthermore, a non-parametric Mann-Kendall method was used to test for a monotonic trend at each grid level, and magnitude was estimated by the Sen’s method. Results show that the most frequent droughts occurred in the middle and lower Awash Basin during the period of analysis (2001-2018). The SPI 12 results indicate that severe hydrological drought events occurred in the middle Awash Basin during the years 2009, 2011, and 2015. Similarly, a large area of significant NDVI declining was found in those years, which coincide with the crop growing seasons. Pixel-based trend analysis revealed significant decreasing trends ( ) of rainfall and NDVI occurred in the middle and lower parts of the basin. Geographically weighted correlation and partial correlation analyses are used to map spatial variations of correlations in a spatial data set. The geographically weighted approach uses a moving-window kernel running across geographical space and calculates a statistical model and summary statistics with distance-decayed weighted data. Although some bandwidth optimization approaches, such as cross-validation, have been proposed, it is important to allow geospatial statistic practitioners to easily explore the influence of spatial scale (localness) on analyses. We demonstrate our developed interactive map as a user-friendly visualization tool to analyze geographically weighted correlation and partial correlation analyses in a web browser. Census data with over 200 variables in Tokyo in 2005 were applied for the demonstration. This paper introduces a generalized conceptual framework for evaluating eco-environmental vulnerability due to any influential variables of interest, including nature and manmade disturbances. Freely accessible remote sensing and census dataset are used to derive the driving variables with aid of Geographical Information System (GIS). Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) or Machine Learning (ML) can be applied to judge the importance and assign the weights of the influential variables. The designed framework is well suitable for eco-environmental assessment at a various spatial scale and a useful tool for assessing and monitoring long-term eco-environmental status due to any impacting factors. Finally, we present results of some case studies that utilize the generalized framework for eco-environmental vulnerability assessment in Vietnam, Indonesia and global scale due to nature and human disturbances. prefecture. The district is located at the mouth of Kaifu river. We evaluated the living environment using the proximity of living facilities and the results of flood depth estimation. From the results of the evaluation, at the central area of the town, the living environment was high, but at the same area, there are many vary of the flood depth. Inland flood depth on the farmland where is the west side of the central area was high. In the future, high living environment area with high flood depth needs to be control new development. And farmland near the central area has important role to mitigate flood risk as a GI, so new development in the area is to be prohibited. Development of This study presents the development of the function designed for 3D visualization of rainfall radar data using the terrain of the unity engine. The provided rainfall radar data is about the rainfall data provided by radars operated in Seoul. The data has an extension of tif, and a resolution of 1000*1000. In order to create a terrain, first, tif files were converted into png and RAW files. When converting png files, tif values were converted into RGB color values and stored according to the arbitrary legendary reference table. The RAW files were converted in the same way, but they are converted not into RGB but into white and black values and used. Based on the legend, the higher value was converted into whiter, and the lower value was converted into blacker. The terrain model was created in a RAW file, and using the png data converted in the Material’s Transparent Shader, the 3-dimensional rainfall radar was implemented. To ensure the utilization of the relevant data, the base map used the Google map, and the Alpha value was designated in the Terrain Material of the created ra","[{'authorId': '101498935', 'name': 'Yunjae Choung'}, {'authorId': '107833700', 'name': 'S.
