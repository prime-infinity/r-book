Building on a case study of the city of Halba (Lebanon) where it maps a process of contingent encounters through which disparate resources, individuals, and groups are stitched together to generate large-scale housing projects that shelter refugees, this paper demonstrates the importance of studying displacement through a grounded reading of the spatial transformations it implicates. The paper maps multiple private and public actors who exploit cracks and connect seemingly disparate material flows (e.g., humanitarian aid, public housing subsidies) and institutional systems (e.g., humanitarian, public, private, religious) in ways that catalyze and accelerate the production of housing in order to derive profit from the opportunities afforded by the refugee crisis. Thus, developers, buyers, residents, brokers, public agents, and other actors all support a flow of informal profitable exchanges that are far from seamless economic transactions, mixing instead capitalist profiteering with human solidarity, religious morality, or kinship obligations that all buttress the possibility of these encounters and their materialization into new configurations of urban quarters. The arrangements formed through these processes, the paper shows, are strongly reflective of existing social hierarchies and inequalities.",NA

Three years later, Lebanon’s Council of Ministers set new regulations for Syrians with the purpose of reducing access to territory and persuading refugees to leave the country. This article analyses the reasons for and the outcomes ofLebanon’s response to the refugee crisis before and after 2014. It then examines, through a qualitative exploratory approach and based on two longitudinal case studies, the impact of Lebanese regulations. In both cases, the socalled ‘temporary gatherings’ became permanent settlements beyond the government’s control. The government’s strategy backfired: in attempting to avoid ghettos, it created them. We conclude that when refugee situations become protracted, most efforts aimed at excluding refugees fail. Excluding refugees increases their vulnerability and reduces their chances of repatriation or resettlement. To prevent this, we argue that hosting policies must lead to the temporary integration of refugees within urban systems and public institutions.","0"

This study aimed to examine the livelihoods, coping strategies, and access to healthcare among SR based on registration status and accompanying formal assistance. A mixed-method approach with more emphasis on the qualitative design was adopted. A purposive convenient sampling approach was used to recruit SR from informal tented settlements (ITS) in the Beqaa region in Lebanon. Data collection included 19 focus group discussions (FGDs) that were conducted with participants, who were further divided into three groups: registered refugees with assistance, registered without assistance and unregistered. Twelve in-depth interviews were conducted with key informants from humanitarian organizations. All interviews and FGDs were audio recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed. SR were highly dependent on formal assistance when received, albeit being insufficient. Regardless of registration status, refugees resorted to informal livelihood strategies, including informal employment, child labor, early marriage, and accruing debt. Poor living conditions and food insecurity were reported among all SR. Limited healthcare access and high out-of-pocket costs led to limited use of antenatal care services, prioritizing life-threatening conditions, and resorting to alternative sources of healthcare. Severity of these conditions and their adverse health consequences were especially pronounced among unregistered refugees. Our findings shed light on the economic and health disparities among marginalized SR, with the lack of registration and formal assistance increasing their vulnerability. More tailored and sustainable humanitarian programs are needed to target the most vulnerable and hard-to-reach groups.","12"

These populations are known to have increased vulnerability and susceptibility to mental and physical health problems due to the migration journey. Access of these individuals to health services, whether during their trajectory of displacement or in refugee-hosting countries, remains limited and challenging due to multiple factors, including language and cultural barriers and unavailability of the refugees’ health records. Cloud-based electronic health records (EHRs) are considered among the top five health technologies integrated in humanitarian crisis preparedness and response during times of conflict. This viewpoint describes the design and implementation of a scalable and innovative cloud-based EHR named Sijilli, which targets refugees in low-resource settings. This paper discusses this solution compared with other similar practices, shedding light on its potential for scalability.","8"

and planning (LPP) that affect education for Syrian refugees in Lebanon. By
applying Hornberger and Johnson’s (2007) concept of approaching multilingual
LPP as a multi-layered onion, disconnects among supranational, national, and local
layers of LPP are critically examined using Tollefson’s (1991) historical-structural
approach and Dryden-Peterson’s (2017, 2019) framework of possible futures. In
this case study, I conclude that multilingual language-in-education policies in
Lebanon often create structural barriers for refugee learners to access and persist
in the national education system. The potential benefits of multilingualism
often are not realized in implementation and multilingual policies exacerbate
educational inequalities and fail to prepare refugees for a variety of possible futures",NA

After a brief sketch of the history of Lebanon, the political situation is analysed, where it is concluded that the political elite primarily is occupied by power politics among themselves. This has a consequence that the governance system is almost politically paralysed when it comes to developing necessary social and economic reforms, leaving it to Lebanese society and the international donor community to handle the refugee crisis. Based on field studies in Lebanon, including in Palestine refugee camps, the situation for Palestinians is described and the `Palestinian protection gap' in terms of human rights is discussed. The chapter concludes that the Syrian crisis has resulted in significant social, economic and political pressure on Palestinians, making their situation concerning protection critical. It further concludes that even if Lebanon on the surface appears to be a cosmopolitan and liberal society, there exists a grim human rights situation concerning migrants in general and Palestinian refugees in particular. As the perspectives for a two-state solution in the Israeli--Palestinian conflict seems further away than ever, the chapter end with a question: What are the prospects for Palestine refugees?",NA
